## Introduction & Motivation

**ProcessForge Shell** is a research‑driven, Unix‑like command interpreter implemented in C. It is designed to expose core shell mechanisms such as parsing, process creation, pipelines, redirection, and signal handling. Unlike typical student shells, ProcessForge emphasizes modularity and extensibility, making it suitable for experimentation with advanced OS features such as job control and custom scheduling.

## Current Implementation

- **Dynamic Prompt:** Interactive sessions show `processforge:/cwd>`; scripted tests suppress prompts for clean output.
- **Parser:** Handles pipes (`|`), redirection (`<`, `>`, `>>`), background execution (`&`), and whitespace/newline cleanup.
- **Executor:** 
  - Builtins (`cd`, `help`, `exit`) handled directly.
  - External commands launched with `fork()` + `execvp()`.
  - Multi‑stage pipelines supported with `pipe()` + `dup2()`.
  - Redirection applied per command.
  - Globbing expands wildcards before execution.
- **Signal Handling:** Custom SIGINT handler restores prompt gracefully.
- **Tests:** Expanded to cover builtins, multi‑stage pipelines, and redirection (append/input).

---

## Key Features

- **External Program Execution:** Launches binaries using `fork()` and `execvp()`.
- **Multi‑Stage Pipelines:** Arbitrary‑length pipelines supported (`cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3 | ...`).
- **Input/Output Redirection:** Supports `<`, `>`, and `>>`.
- **Background Execution:** Handles `&` for background jobs.
- **Signal Handling:** Manages interrupts (Ctrl+C).
- **Built‑in Commands:** Includes `cd`, `help`, and `exit`.
- **Dynamic Prompt:** Shows current working directory in interactive mode.

## System Calls Used

| System Call | Purpose           |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| fork()      | Create process    |
| execvp()    | Load program      |
| waitpid()   | Synchronize child |
| pipe()      | IPC (pipelines)   |
| dup2()      | Redirection       |
| open()      | Open files for redirection |
| chdir()     | Change directory  |
| getcwd()    | Current directory |
| sigaction() | Install SIGINT handler |

---

## Build & Run

```bash
make clean && make
./build/processforge
```

---

## Example Usage

```
processforge:/home/user/project> help
processforge:/home/user/project> ls | grep .c | sort | wc -l
processforge:/home/user/project> echo hello > out.txt
processforge:/home/user/project> cat < out.txt
processforge:/home/user/project> sleep 5 &
processforge:/home/user/project> exit
```

---

## Tests

Generated runtime test artifacts are placed in `tests/temp/`, while committed test inputs and expected outputs remain in `tests/fixtures/` and `tests/expected/`.

```bash
make clean && make
./tests/test_builtins.sh
./tests/test_redirection.sh
./tests/test_pipes.sh
```

After running tests, `tests/temp/` may contain temporary files created by redirection tests. These files are intentionally isolated and can be removed manually with:

```bash
rm -rf tests/temp/*
```

---

## Research Directions

ProcessForge is evolving into a research platform for studying OS concepts:

- **Job Control:** Implement `jobs`, `fg`, `bg`, and `kill` with a job table.
- **Scheduling Policies:** Add FCFS, SJF, and Round Robin schedulers for background jobs.
- **Instrumentation:** Collect metrics (latency, turnaround time, resource usage).
- **Prompt Extensions:** Show job count and scheduler policy in the prompt.
- **Reproducibility:** Document experiments in `docs/` and expand automated test coverage.
